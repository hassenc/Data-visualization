Just run index.html to see the interactive visualization.

Browser:
If you are running it locally you may have a problem seeing the visualization with chrome (you 'll have to enable the file reading flag).It works fine with Firefox.
It works fine on both of Chrome and firefox if it's hosted (localhost or web host).

Feel free to contact me if you have any problem.
